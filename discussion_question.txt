Welp I'm in a fantasy mood and both of grandparents were avid fiction readers so let's see how this goes:

Imagine you're Saruman (before you got all evil) in the tower of Orthanc. You're trying to design a catapult. You're keeping a separate version of each of your blueprints as the evolution of the design continues, and filing them in chronological order. This way, if one of your newer blueprints fails, you can go back to an earlier version and continue from there.

Meanwhile, there is a vast library in Minas Tirith, and you want to send copies of your blueprints there, so you regularly send a messenger to the capital of Gondor with your copies. You do this for two reasons: to store a backup of your blueprints somewhere besides your home of Orthanc, and to have your blueprints available to the men in Minas Tirith. These men can then review your blueprints, or even make copies of their own and make efforts to improve upon them.
